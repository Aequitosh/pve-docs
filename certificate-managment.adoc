Certificates for communication within the cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each {PVE} cluster creates its own internal Certificate Authority (CA) and
generates a self-signed certificate for each node. These certificates are used
for encrypted communication with the cluster's pveproxy service and the
Shell/Console feature if SPICE is used.

The CA certificate and key are stored in the xref:chapter_pmxcfs[Proxmox Cluster File System (pmxcfs)].

Certificates for API and web GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The REST API and web GUI are provided by the `pveproxy` service, which runs on
each node.

You have the following options for the certificate used by `pveproxy`:

1. By default the node-specific certificate in
`/etc/pve/nodes/NODENAME/pve-ssl.pem` is used. This certificate is signed by
the cluster CA and therefore not trusted by browsers and operating systems by
default.
2. use an externally provided certificate (e.g. signed by a commercial CA).
3. use ACME (e.g., Let's Encrypt) to get a trusted certificate with automatic renewal.

For options 2 and 3 the file `/etc/pve/local/pveproxy-ssl.pem` (and
`/etc/pve/local/pveproxy-ssl.key`, which needs to be without password) is used.

Certificates are managed with the {PVE} Node management command
(see the `pvenode(1)` manpage).

WARNING: Do not replace or manually modify the automatically generated node
certificate files in `/etc/pve/local/pve-ssl.pem` and
`/etc/pve/local/pve-ssl.key` or the cluster CA files in
`/etc/pve/pve-root-ca.pem` and `/etc/pve/priv/pve-root-ca.key`.

Getting trusted certificates via ACME
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
{PVE} includes an implementation of the **A**utomatic **C**ertificate
**M**anagement **E**nvironment **ACME** protocol, allowing {pve} admins to
interface with Let's Encrypt for easy setup of trusted TLS certificates which
are accepted out of the box on most modern operating systems and browsers.

Currently the two ACME endpoints implemented are Let's Encrypt (LE) and its
staging environment (see https://letsencrypt.org), both using the standalone
HTTP challenge.

Because of https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/[rate-limits] you should use
LE `staging` for experiments.

There are a few prerequisites to use Let's Encrypt:

1. **Port 80** of the node needs to be reachable from the internet.
2. There **must** be no other listener on port 80.
3. The requested (sub)domain needs to resolve to a public IP of the Node.
4. You have to accept the ToS of Let's Encrypt.

At the moment the GUI uses only the default ACME account.

Switching from the `staging` to the regular ACME directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Changing the ACME directory for an account is unsupported. If you want to switch
an account from the `staging` ACME directory to the regular, trusted, one you
need to deactivate it and recreate it.

This procedure is also needed to change the default ACME account used in the GUI.

.Example: Changing the `default` ACME account from the `staging` to the regular directory

Automatic renewal of ACME certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a node has been successfully configured with an ACME-provided certificate
(either via pvenode or via the GUI), the certificate will be automatically
renewed by the pve-daily-update.service. Currently, renewal will be attempted
if the certificate has expired or will expire in the next 30 days.
