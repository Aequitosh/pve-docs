Package Repositories
--------------------

All Debian based systems use
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool[APT] as package
management tool. The list of repositories is defined in
'/etc/apt/sources.list' and '.list' files found inside
'/etc/apt/sources.d/'. Updates can be installed directly using
'apt-get', or via the GUI.

Apt 'sources.list' files list one package repository per line, with
the most preferred source listed first. Empty lines are ignored, and a
'#' character anywhere on a line marks the remainder of that line as a
comment. The information available from the configured sources is
acquired by 'apt-get update'.

.File '/etc/apt/sources.list'
----
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org jessie/updates main contrib
----

In addition, {pve} provides three different package repositories.

{pve} Enterprise Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default, stable and recommended repository, available for
all {pve} subscription users. It contains the most stable packages,
and is suitable for production use. You need a valid subscription key
to access this repository. The `pve-enterprise` repository is enabled
by default:

.File '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pve-enterprise.list'
----
deb https://enterprise.proxmox.com/debian jessie pve-enterprise
----

NOTE: You can disable this repository by commenting out the above line
using a '#' (at the start of the line). This prevents error messages
if you do not have a subscription key. Please configure the
`pve-no-subscription` repository in that case.

As soon as updates are available, the `root@pam` user is notified via
email about the available new packages. On the GUI, the change-log of
each package can be viewed (if available), showing all details of the
update. So you will never miss important security fixes.

{pve} No-Subscription Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As the name suggests, you do not need a subscription key to access
this repository. It can be used for testing and non-production
use. Its not recommended to run on production servers, as these
packages are not always heavily tested and validated.

We recommend to configure this repository in '/etc/apt/sources.list'.

.File '/etc/apt/sources.list'
----
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian jessie main contrib

# PVE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
# NOT recommended for production use
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian jessie pve-no-subscription

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org jessie/updates main contrib
----

 
{pve} Test Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, there is a repository called `pvetest`. This one contains the
latest packages and is heavily used by developers to test new
features. As usual, you can configure this using
'/etc/apt/sources.list' by adding the following line:

.sources.list entry for `pvetest`

deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian jessie pvetest
