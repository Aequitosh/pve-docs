=======================
include::attributes.txt[]
endif::manvolnum[]

The '/etc/pve/lxc/<CTID>.conf' files stores container configuration,
where "CTID" is the numeric ID of the given container. Note that IDs <=
100 are reserved for internal purposes.


File Format
-----------

The file uses a simple colon separated key/value format. Each line has
the following format:

 OPTION: value

Blank lines in the file are ignored, and lines starting with a '#'
character are treated as comments and are also ignored.

One can use the 'pct' command to generate and modify those files.

It is also possible to add low-level lxc style configuration directly, for
example:

 lxc.init_cmd: /sbin/my_own_init

or 

 lxc.init_cmd = /sbin/my_own_init

Those settings are directly passed to the lxc low-level tools.
