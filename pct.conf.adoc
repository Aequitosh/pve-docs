The `/etc/pve/lxc/<CTID>.conf` files stores container configuration,
where `CTID` is the numeric ID of the given container.

NOTE: IDs < 100 are reserved for internal purposes.


File Format
-----------

The file uses a simple colon separated key/value format. Each line has
the following format:

 OPTION: value

Blank lines in the file are ignored, and lines starting with a `#`
character are treated as comments and are also ignored.

One can use the `pct` command to generate and modify those files.

It is also possible to add low-level LXC-style configuration directly, for
example:

 lxc.init_cmd: /sbin/my_own_init

or 

 lxc.init_cmd = /sbin/my_own_init

Those settings are directly passed to the LXC low-level tools.
