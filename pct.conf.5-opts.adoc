`arch`: `<amd64 | arm64 | armhf | i386>` ('default =' `amd64`)::

OS architecture type.

`cmode`: `<console | shell | tty>` ('default =' `tty`)::

Console mode. By default, the console command tries to open a connection to one of the available tty devices. By setting cmode to 'console' it tries to attach to /dev/console instead. If you set cmode to 'shell', it simply invokes a shell inside the container (no login).

`console`: `<boolean>` ('default =' `1`)::

Attach a console device (/dev/console) to the container.

`cores`: `<integer> (1 - 128)` ::

The number of cores assigned to the container. A container can use all available cores by default.

`cpulimit`: `<number> (0 - 128)` ('default =' `0`)::

Limit of CPU usage.
+
NOTE: If the computer has 2 CPUs, it has a total of '2' CPU time. Value '0' indicates no CPU limit.

`cpuunits`: `<integer> (0 - 500000)` ('default =' `1024`)::

CPU weight for a VM. Argument is used in the kernel fair scheduler. The larger the number is, the more CPU time this VM gets. Number is relative to the weights of all the other running VMs.
+
NOTE: You can disable fair-scheduler configuration by setting this to 0.

`description`: `<string>` ::

Container description. Only used on the configuration web interface.

`features`: `[fuse=<1|0>] [,keyctl=<1|0>] [,mount=<fstype;fstype;...>] [,nesting=<1|0>]` ::

Allow containers access to advanced features.

`fuse`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Allow using 'fuse' file systems in a container. Note that interactions between fuse and the freezer cgroup can potentially cause I/O deadlocks.

`keyctl`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

For unprivileged containers only: Allow the use of the keyctl() system call. This is required to use docker inside a container. By default unprivileged containers will see this system call as non-existent. This is mostly a workaround for systemd-networkd, as it will treat it as a fatal error when some keyctl() operations are denied by the kernel due to lacking permissions. Essentially, you can choose between running systemd-networkd or docker.

`mount`=`<fstype;fstype;...>` ;;

Allow mounting file systems of specific types. This should be a list of file system types as used with the mount command. Note that this can have negative effects on the container's security. With access to a loop device, mounting a file can circumvent the mknod permission of the devices cgroup, mounting an NFS file system can block the host's I/O completely and prevent it from rebooting, etc.

`nesting`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Allow nesting. Best used with unprivileged containers with additional id mapping. Note that this will expose procfs and sysfs contents of the host to the guest.

Read-only mount point

`shared`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Mark this non-volume mount point as available on all nodes.
+
WARNING: This option does not share the mount point automatically, it assumes it is shared already!

`size`=`<DiskSize>` ;;

Volume size (read only value).

`volume`=`<volume>` ;;

Volume, device or directory to mount into the container.

`nameserver`: `<string>` ::

Sets DNS server IP address for a container. Create will automatically use the setting from the host if you neither set searchdomain nor nameserver.

`net[n]`: `name=<string> [,bridge=<bridge>] [,firewall=<1|0>] [,gw=<GatewayIPv4>] [,gw6=<GatewayIPv6>] [,hwaddr=<XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX>] [,ip=<(IPv4/CIDR|dhcp|manual)>] [,ip6=<(IPv6/CIDR|auto|dhcp|manual)>] [,mtu=<integer>] [,rate=<mbps>] [,tag=<integer>] [,trunks=<vlanid[;vlanid...]>] [,type=<veth>]` ::

`bridge`=`<bridge>` ;;

Bridge to attach the network device to.

`firewall`=`<boolean>` ;;

Controls whether this interface's firewall rules should be used.

`gw`=`<GatewayIPv4>` ;;

`gw6`=`<GatewayIPv6>` ;;

`ip`=`<(IPv4/CIDR|dhcp|manual)>` ;;

`ip6`=`<(IPv6/CIDR|auto|dhcp|manual)>` ;;

`tag`=`<integer> (1 - 4094)` ;;

`onboot`: `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Specifies whether a VM will be started during system bootup.

`ostype`: `<alpine | archlinux | centos | debian | fedora | gentoo | opensuse | ubuntu | unmanaged>` ::

`protection`: `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

`rootfs`: `[volume=]<volume> [,acl=<1|0>] [,quota=<1|0>] [,replicate=<1|0>] [,ro=<1|0>] [,shared=<1|0>] [,size=<DiskSize>]` ::

`replicate`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `1`);;

Will include this volume to a storage replica job.

`ro`=`<boolean>` ;;

Read-only mount point

`shared`=`<boolean>` ('default =' `0`);;

Mark this non-volume mount point as available on all nodes.
+

`size`=`<DiskSize>` ;;

Volume size (read only value).

`volume`=`<volume>` ;;

Volume, device or directory to mount into the container.

`searchdomain`: `<string>` ::

Sets DNS search domains for a container. Create will automatically use the setting from the host if you neither set searchdomain nor nameserver.

`startup`: `[[order=]\d+] [,up=\d+] [,down=\d+] ` ::
