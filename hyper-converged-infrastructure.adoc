{pve} has all the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure[Hyper-converged Infrastructure]
capabilities needed to deploy and manage a complete open source hyper-converged
infrastructure.

It integrates tightly compute, networking, and storage resources into
a single deployment unit and you can manage everything with the
centralized web management interface. {pve} unifies your compute
and storage systems, i.e. you can use the same physical nodes within a
cluster for both computing (processing VMs and Containers) as well as
for replicated storage.
