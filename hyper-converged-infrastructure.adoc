Proxmox VE has all the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure[Hyper-converged Infrastructure] capabilities needed to deploy and manage a complete open source hyper-converged 
infrastructure. 
It integrates tightly compute, networking, and storage resources into a single deployment unit and you can manage everything with the centralized web management interface. 
Proxmox VE unifies your compute and storage systems, i.e. you can use the same physical nodes within a cluster for both computing (processing VMs and Containers) as well as for replicated storage.
