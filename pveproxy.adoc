This daemon exposes the whole {pve} API on TCP port 8006 using
HTTPS. It runs as user 'www-data' and has very limited permissions.
Operation requiring more permissions are forwarded to the local
'pvedaemon'.

Request targeted for other nodes are automatically forwarded to that
node. This means that you can manage your whole cluster by connecting
to a single {pve} node.
