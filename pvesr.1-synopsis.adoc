*pvesr* `<COMMAND> [ARGS] [OPTIONS]`

*pvesr create-local-job* `<id> <target>` `[OPTIONS]`

Create a new replication job

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

`<target>`: `<string>` ::

Target node.

`--comment` `<string>` ::

Description.

`--disable` `<boolean>` ::

Flag to disable/deactivate the entry.

`--rate` `<number> (1 - N)` ::

Rate limit in mbps (megabytes per second) as floating point number.

`--remove_job` `<full | local>` ::

Mark the replication job for removal. The job will remove all local replication snapshots. When set to 'full', it also tries to remove replicated volumes on the target. The job then removes itself from the configuration file.

`--schedule` `<string>` ('default =' `*/15`)::

Storage replication schedule. The format is a subset of `systemd` calender events.

`--source` `<string>` ::

Source of the replication.

*pvesr delete* `<id>` `[OPTIONS]`

Mark replication job for removal.

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

`--force` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Will remove the jobconfig entry, but will not cleanup.

`--keep` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Keep replicated data at target (do not remove).

*pvesr disable* `<id>`

Disable a replication job.

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

*pvesr enable* `<id>`

Enable a replication job.

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

*pvesr finalize-local-job* `<id> [<extra-args>]` `[OPTIONS]`

Finalize a replication job. This removes all replications snapshots with
timestamps different than <last_sync>.

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

`<extra-args>`: `<array>` ::

The list of volume IDs to consider.

`--last_sync` `<integer> (0 - N)` ::

Time (UNIX epoch) of last successful sync. If not specified, all replication snapshots gets removed.

*pvesr help* `[OPTIONS]`

Get help about specified command.

`--extra-args` `<array>` ::

Shows help for a specific command

`--verbose` `<boolean>` ::

Verbose output format.

*pvesr list*

List replication jobs.

*pvesr prepare-local-job* `<id> [<extra-args>]` `[OPTIONS]`

Prepare for starting a replication job. This is called on the target node
before replication starts. This call is for internal use, and return a JSON
object on stdout. The method first test if VM <vmid> reside on the local
node. If so, stop immediately. After that the method scans all volume IDs
for snapshots, and removes all replications snapshots with timestamps
different than <last_sync>. It also removes any unused volumes. Returns a
hash with boolean markers for all volumes with existing replication
snapshots.

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

`<extra-args>`: `<array>` ::

The list of volume IDs to consider.

`--force` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Allow to remove all existion volumes (empty volume list).

`--last_sync` `<integer> (0 - N)` ::

Time (UNIX epoch) of last successful sync. If not specified, all replication snapshots get removed.

`--parent_snapname` `<string>` ::

The name of the snapshot.

`--scan` `<string>` ::

List of storage IDs to scan for stale volumes.

*pvesr read* `<id>`

Read replication job configuration.

`<id>`: `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::

Replication Job ID. The ID is composed of a Guest ID and a job number, separated by a hyphen, i.e. '<GUEST>-<JOBNUM>'.

*pvesr run* `[OPTIONS]`

This method is called by the systemd-timer and executes all (or a specific)
sync jobs.

`--id` `[1-9][0-9]{2,8}-\d{1,9}` ::
