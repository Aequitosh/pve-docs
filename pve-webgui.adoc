Proxmox WebGUI
--------------
include::attributes.txt[]

{pve} is simple. There is no need to install a separate
management tool, everything can be done via your web browser (Latest
Firefox and Google Chrome is preferred). To access
VM/CT console, a built in HTML5 console is used. As alternative, SPICE
can be used.

As we use Proxmox Cluster file system (pmxcfs),you can connect to any
node to manage the whole cluster.

To use the Central Web-based Management, you need a modern browser,
this includes:

* Firefox, a release from the current year, or the latest Enterprise
* Support Release Chrome, a release from the current year
* Microsoft currently supported versions of Edge Browser
* Apple currently supported versions of Safari

If {pve} detect you're connecting from a mobile device, you will
redirected to a light weight touch based UI.

The web interface can be reached via https://youripaddress:8006
(default login is: root, the password is specified during the
installation).

Web Gui overview:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GUI has 3 sectors:

* On the left side is the navigation bar. The navigation bar is
  structured into 4 different types. It has 4 different views,
  which can be selected on the top.
** Datacenter: contains all the settings belonging to all machines.
** Nodes: represent the host where the VM/CT runs on. It is named like
   the hostname. Normally the name was set by the installation.
** Entity: can be a VM, container or a storage.
** Logical pools: it is possible to group entities to a group for easy management.
* On the right side is the main management center, where all content
  of the selected entity form the navigation bar is shown.
* On the bottom is the task log section, where all tasks are shown.
