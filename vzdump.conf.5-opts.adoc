`bwlimit`: `<integer> (0 - N)` ('default =' `0`)::

Limit I/O bandwidth (in KiB/s).

`compress`: `<0 | 1 | gzip | lzo | zstd>` ('default =' `0`)::

Compress dump file.

`dumpdir`: `<string>` ::

Store resulting files to specified directory.

`exclude-path`: `<array>` ::

Exclude certain files/directories (shell globs). Paths starting with '/' are anchored to the container's root,  other paths match relative to each subdirectory.

`ionice`: `<integer> (0 - 8)` ('default =' `7`)::

Set IO priority when using the BFQ scheduler. For snapshot and suspend mode backups of VMs, this only affects the compressor. A value of 8 means the idle priority is used, otherwise the best-effort priority is used with the specified value.

`lockwait`: `<integer> (0 - N)` ('default =' `180`)::

Maximal time to wait for the global lock (minutes).

`mailnotification`: `<always | failure>` ('default =' `always`)::

Deprecated: use 'notification-policy' instead.

`mailto`: `<string>` ::

Comma-separated list of email addresses or users that should receive email notifications. Has no effect if the 'notification-target' option  is set at the same time.

`maxfiles`: `<integer> (1 - N)` ::

Deprecated: use 'prune-backups' instead. Maximal number of backup files per guest system.

`mode`: `<snapshot | stop | suspend>` ('default =' `snapshot`)::

Backup mode.

`notes-template`: `<string>` ::

Template string for generating notes for the backup(s). It can contain variables which will be replaced by their values. Currently supported are \{\{cluster\}\}, \{\{guestname\}\}, \{\{node\}\}, and \{\{vmid\}\}, but more might be added in the future. Needs to be a single line, newline and backslash need to be escaped as '\n' and '\\' respectively.
+
NOTE: Requires option(s): `storage`

`notification-policy`: `<always | failure | never>` ('default =' `always`)::

Specify when to send a notification

`notification-target`: `<string>` ::

Determine the target to which notifications should be sent. Can either be a notification endpoint or a notification group. This option takes precedence over 'mailto', meaning that if both are  set, the 'mailto' option will be ignored.

`performance`: `[max-workers=<integer>] [,pbs-entries-max=<integer>]` ::

Other performance-related settings.

`max-workers`=`<integer> (1 - 256)` ('default =' `16`);;

Applies to VMs. Allow up to this many IO workers at the same time.

`pbs-entries-max`=`<integer> (1 - N)` ('default =' `1048576`);;

Applies to container backups sent to PBS. Limits the number of entries allowed in memory at a given time to avoid unintended OOM situations. Increase it to enable backups of containers with a large amount of files.

`pigz`: `<integer>` ('default =' `0`)::

Use pigz instead of gzip when N>0. N=1 uses half of cores, N>1 uses N as thread count.

`pool`: `<string>` ::

Backup all known guest systems included in the specified pool.

`protected`: `<boolean>` ::

If true, mark backup(s) as protected.
+
NOTE: Requires option(s): `storage`

`prune-backups`: `[keep-all=<1|0>] [,keep-daily=<N>] [,keep-hourly=<N>] [,keep-last=<N>] [,keep-monthly=<N>] [,keep-weekly=<N>] [,keep-yearly=<N>]` ('default =' `keep-all=1`)::

Use these retention options instead of those from the storage configuration.

`keep-all`=`<boolean>` ;;

Keep all backups. Conflicts with the other options when true.

`keep-daily`=`<N>` ;;

Keep backups for the last <N> different days. If there is morethan one backup for a single day, only the latest one is kept.

`keep-hourly`=`<N>` ;;

Keep backups for the last <N> different hours. If there is morethan one backup for a single hour, only the latest one is kept.

`keep-last`=`<N>` ;;

Keep the last <N> backups.

`keep-monthly`=`<N>` ;;

Keep backups for the last <N> different months. If there is morethan one backup for a single month, only the latest one is kept.

`keep-weekly`=`<N>` ;;

Keep backups for the last <N> different weeks. If there is morethan one backup for a single week, only the latest one is kept.

`keep-yearly`=`<N>` ;;

Keep backups for the last <N> different years. If there is morethan one backup for a single year, only the latest one is kept.

`remove`: `<boolean>` ('default =' `1`)::

Prune older backups according to 'prune-backups'.

`script`: `<string>` ::

Use specified hook script.

`stdexcludes`: `<boolean>` ('default =' `1`)::

Exclude temporary files and logs.

`stopwait`: `<integer> (0 - N)` ('default =' `10`)::

Maximal time to wait until a guest system is stopped (minutes).

`storage`: `<string>` ::

Store resulting file to this storage.

`tmpdir`: `<string>` ::

Store temporary files to specified directory.

`zstd`: `<integer>` ('default =' `1`)::

Zstd threads. N=0 uses half of the available cores, N>0 uses N as thread count.
