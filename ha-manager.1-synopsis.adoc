*ha-manager* `<COMMAND> [ARGS] [OPTIONS]`

*ha-manager add* `<sid>` `[OPTIONS]`

Create a new HA resource.

`<sid>`: `<type>:<name>` ::

HA resource ID. This consists of a resource type followed by a resource specific name, separated with colon (example: vm:100 / ct:100). For virtual machines and containers, you can simply use the VM or CT id as a shortcut (example: 100).

`-comment` `<string>` ::

Description.

`-group` `<string>` ::

The HA group identifier.

`-max_relocate` `<integer> (0 - N)` ('default =' `1`)::

Maximal number of service relocate tries when a service failes to start.

`-max_restart` `<integer> (0 - N)` ('default =' `1`)::

Maximal number of tries to restart the service on a node after its start failed.

`-state` `<disabled | enabled>` ('default =' `enabled`)::

Resource state.

`-type` `<ct | vm>` ::

Resource type.



*ha-manager config* `[OPTIONS]`

List HA resources.

`-type` `<ct | vm>` ::

Only list resources of specific type




*ha-manager disable* `<sid>`

Disable a HA resource.

`<sid>`: `<type>:<name>` ::

HA resource ID. This consists of a resource type followed by a resource specific name, separated with colon (example: vm:100 / ct:100). For virtual machines and containers, you can simply use the VM or CT id as a shortcut (example: 100).



*ha-manager enable* `<sid>`

Enable a HA resource.

`<sid>`: `<type>:<name>` ::

HA resource ID. This consists of a resource type followed by a resource specific name, separated with colon (example: vm:100 / ct:100). For virtual machines and containers, you can simply use the VM or CT id as a shortcut (example: 100).




*ha-manager groupadd* `<group> -nodes <string>` `[OPTIONS]`

Create a new HA group.

`<group>`: `<string>` ::

The HA group identifier.

`-comment` `<string>` ::

Description.

`-nodes` `<node>[:<pri>]{,<node>[:<pri>]}*` ::

List of cluster node names with optional priority. We use priority '0' as default. The CRM tries to run services on the node with highest priority (also see option 'nofailback').

`-nofailback` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

The CRM tries to run services on the node with the highest priority. If a node with higher priority comes online, the CRM migrates the service to that node. Enabling nofailback prevents that behavior.

`-restricted` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Services on unrestricted groups may run on any cluster members if all group members are offline. But they will migrate back as soon as a group member comes online. One can implement a 'preferred node' behavior using an unrestricted group with one member.

`-type` `<group>` ::

Group type.



*ha-manager groupconfig*

Get HA groups.



*ha-manager groupremove* `<group>`

Delete ha group configuration.

`<group>`: `<string>` ::

The HA group identifier.



*ha-manager groupset* `<group>` `[OPTIONS]`

Update ha group configuration.

`<group>`: `<string>` ::

The HA group identifier.

`-comment` `<string>` ::

Description.

`-delete` `<string>` ::

A list of settings you want to delete.

`-digest` `<string>` ::

Prevent changes if current configuration file has different SHA1 digest. This can be used to prevent concurrent modifications.

`-nodes` `<node>[:<pri>]{,<node>[:<pri>]}*` ::

List of cluster node names with optional priority. We use priority '0' as default. The CRM tries to run services on the node with highest priority (also see option 'nofailback').

`-nofailback` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

The CRM tries to run services on the node with the highest priority. If a node with higher priority comes online, the CRM migrates the service to that node. Enabling nofailback prevents that behavior.

`-restricted` `<boolean>` ('default =' `0`)::

Services on unrestricted groups may run on any cluster members if all group members are offline. But they will migrate back as soon as a group member comes online. One can implement a 'preferred node' behavior using an unrestricted group with one member.




*ha-manager help* `[<cmd>]` `[OPTIONS]`

Get help about specified command.

`<cmd>`: `<string>` ::

Command name

`-verbose` `<boolean>` ::

Verbose output format.




*ha-manager migrate* `<sid> <node>`

Request resource migration (online) to another node.

`<sid>`: `<type>:<name>` ::

HA resource ID. This consists of a resource type followed by a resource specific name, separated with colon (example: vm:100 / ct:100). For virtual machines and containers, you can simply use the VM or CT id as a shortcut (example: 100).

`<node>`: `<string>` ::

The cluster node name.



*ha-manager relocate* `<sid> <node>`

Request resource relocatzion to another node. This stops the service on the
old node, and restarts it on the target node.

`<sid>`: `<type>:<name>` ::

HA resource ID. This consists of a resource type followed by a resource specific name, separated with colon (example: vm:100 / ct:100). For virtual machines and containers, you can simply use the VM or CT id as a shortcut (example: 100).

`<node>`: `<string>` ::

The cluster node name.



*ha-manager remove* `<sid>`

Delete resource configuration.

`<sid>`: `<type>:<name>` ::

*ha-manager set* `<sid>` `[OPTIONS]`

Update resource configuration.

`<sid>`: `<type>:<name>` ::
