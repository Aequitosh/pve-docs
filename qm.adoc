=========================

qm is a script to manage virtual machines with Qemu/Kvm. You can
create and destroy virtual machines, and control execution
(start/stop/suspend/resume). Besides that, you can use qm to set
parameters in the associated config file. It is also possible to
create and delete virtual disks.

Configuration
-------------

All configuration files consists of lines in the form

 PARAMETER: value

See 'man vm.conf' for a complete list of options.

Configuration files are stored inside the Proxmox configuration file
system, and can be access at '/etc/pve/qemu-server/<VMID>.conf'.

The default for option `keyboard` is read from
'/etc/pve/datacenter.conf'.

Locks
-----

Online migration and backups ('vzdump') set a lock to prevent
unintentional action on such VMs. Sometimes you need remove such lock
manually (power failure).

 qm unlock <vmid>

Examples
--------

Create a new VM with 4 GB IDE disk.

 qm create 300 -ide0 4 -net0 e1000 -cdrom proxmox-mailgateway_2.1.iso

Start the new VM

 qm start 300

Send a shutdown request, then wait until the VM is stopped.

 qm shutdown 300 && qm wait 300

Same as above, but only wait for 40 seconds.

 qm shutdown 300 && qm wait 300 -timeout 40
