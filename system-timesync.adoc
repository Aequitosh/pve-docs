Time Synchronization
--------------------
include::attributes.txt[]

The {pve} cluster stack itself relies heavily on the fact that all
the nodes have precisely synchronized time. Some other components,
like Ceph, also refuse to work properly if the local time on nodes is
not in sync.

Time synchronization between nodes can be achieved with the ``Network
Time Protocol'' (`NTP`). {pve} uses `systemd-timesyncd` as NTP client
by default, preconfigured to use a set of public servers. This setup
works out of the box in most cases.


Using Custom NTP Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, it might be desired to not use the default NTP
servers. For example, if your {pve} nodes do not have access to the
public internet (e.g., because of restrictive firewall rules), you
need to setup local NTP servers and tell `systemd-timesyncd` to use
them:

.File `/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf`
----
[Time]
Servers=ntp1.example.com ntp2.example.com ntp3.example.com ntp4.example.com
----

After restarting the synchronization service (`systemctl restart
systemd-timesyncd`) you should verify that your newly configured NTP
servers are used by checking the journal (`journalctl --since -1h -u
systemd-timesyncd`):
