`cipassword`: `<string>` ::

Password to assign the user. Using this is generally not recommended. Use ssh keys instead. Also note that older cloud-init versions do not support hashed passwords.

`citype`: `<configdrive2 | nocloud>` ::

Specifies the cloud-init configuration format. The default depends on the configured operating system type (`ostype`. We use the `nocloud` format for Linux, and `configdrive2` for windows.

`ciuser`: `<string>` ::

User name to change ssh keys and password for instead of the image's configured default user.

`ipconfig[n]`: `[gw=<GatewayIPv4>] [,gw6=<GatewayIPv6>] [,ip=<IPv4Format/CIDR>] [,ip6=<IPv6Format/CIDR>]` ::

Specify IP addresses and gateways for the corresponding interface.
+
IP addresses use CIDR notation, gateways are optional but need an IP of the same type specified.
+
The special string 'dhcp' can be used for IP addresses to use DHCP, in which case no explicit gateway should be provided.
SLAAC is not supported by cloud-init but at least netplan activates SLAAC when selecting 'dhcp' so it should work with up-to-date netplan versions.
+
If cloud-init is enabled and neither an IPv4 nor an IPv6 address is specified, it defaults to using dhcp on IPv4.

`gw`=`<GatewayIPv4>` ;;

Default gateway for IPv4 traffic.
+
NOTE: Requires option(s): `ip`

`gw6`=`<GatewayIPv6>` ;;

Default gateway for IPv6 traffic.
+
NOTE: Requires option(s): `ip6`

`ip`=`<IPv4Format/CIDR>` ('default =' `dhcp`);;

IPv4 address in CIDR format.

`ip6`=`<IPv6Format/CIDR>` ('default =' `dhcp`);;

IPv6 address in CIDR format.

`nameserver`: `<string>` ::

Sets DNS server IP address for a container. Create will automatically use the setting from the host if neither searchdomain nor nameserver are set.

`searchdomain`: `<string>` ::

Sets DNS search domains for a container. Create will automatically use the setting from the host if neither searchdomain nor nameserver are set.

`sshkeys`: `<string>` ::

Setup public SSH keys (one key per line, OpenSSH format).
