Getting Help
------------

There are basically two different support channels. {pve} itself if
fully open source, so we always encourage our users to discuss and
share their knowledge using the http://forum.proxmox.com/[Community
Support Forum]. The forum is fully moderated by the Proxmox support
team. Up to now, the forum has about 25.000 members, and more than
120.000 messages. Needless to say that such a large forum is a great
place to get information.

The second channel is the commercial support provided by
{proxmoxGmbh}. {pve} server subscriptions can be ordered online, see
http://shop.maurer-it.com[{pve} Shop]. For all details see
http://www.proxmox.com/proxmox-ve/pricing[{pve} Subscription Service
Plans].

Please contact the mailto:office@proxmox.com[Proxmox sales team] for
commercial support requests or volume discounts.
