Proxmox VE Wiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary source of information is the {webwiki}. It combines the reference
documentation with user contributed content.


Community Support Forum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{pve} itself is fully open source, so we always encourage our users to
discuss and share their knowledge using the {forum}. The forum is fully
moderated by the Proxmox support team, and has a quite large user base
around the whole world. Needless to say that such a large forum is a
great place to get information.

community

Bug Tracker
~~~~~~~~~~~

We also run a public bug tracker at
https://bugzilla.proxmox.com. If you ever detect an issue, you can
file a bug report there. This makes it easy to track its status, and
you will get notified as soon as the problem is fixed.
