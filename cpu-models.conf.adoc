The `/etc/pve/virtual-guest/cpu-models.conf` file stores custom CPU
models, which can be used by VMs to get access to advanced CPU
features (for example custom CPU flags).


File Format
-----------

CPU models each have their own section in the file, beginning with
the header:

 cpu-model: <name>

Note that <name> does not include the 'custom-' prefix, which is
required in VM configs to denote custom CPU models.

For example, if the <name> is 'foobar', the CPU for a VM would need to be
configured as 'custom-foobar'.

Each section can specify several options. They are indented by either one TAB
character or multiple spaces. Every option and its value is separated by one
space, for example:

 reported-model qemu64

See below for all available options.

Blank lines and those starting with a `#` are ignored.
