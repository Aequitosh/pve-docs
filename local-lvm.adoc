Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
----------------------------

Most people install {pve} directly on a local disk. The {pve}
installation CD offers several options for local disk management. The
current default setup uses LVM and 'ext4' for the root
partition. LVM-thin is used for VM images, because this has efficient
support for snapshots and clones.
