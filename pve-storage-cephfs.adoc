Storage pool type: `cephfs`

http://ceph.com[Ceph] is a distributed object store and file system designed to
provide excellent performance, reliability and scalability. CephFS implements a
POSIX-compliant filesystem storage, with the following advantages:

* thin provisioning
* distributed and redundant (striped over multiple OSDs)
* snapshot capabilities
* self healing
* no single point of failure
* scalable to the exabyte level
* kernel and user space implementation available

NOTE: For smaller deployments, it is also possible to run Ceph
services directly on your {pve} nodes. Recent hardware has plenty
of CPU power and RAM, so running storage services and VMs on same node
is possible.

[[storage_cephfs_config]]
Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This backend supports the common storage properties `nodes`,
`disable`, `content`, and the following `cephfs` specific properties:

monhost::

List of monitor daemon IPs. Optional, only needed if Ceph is not running on the
PVE cluster.

path::

The local mount point. Optional, defaults to `/mnt/pve/<STORAGE_ID>/`.

username::

Ceph user Id. Optional, only needed if Ceph is not running on the PVE cluster.

subdir::

CephFS subdirectory to mount. Optional, defaults to `/`.

fuse::

Access CephFS through FUSE, instead of the kernel client. Optional, defaults
to `0`.

.Configuration Example for a external Ceph cluster (`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`)
----
cephfs: cephfs-external
        monhost 10.1.1.20 10.1.1.21 10.1.1.22
        path /mnt/pve/cephfs-external
        content backup
        username admin
----

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use `cephx` authentication, you need to copy the secret from your
external Ceph cluster to a Proxmox VE host.

Create the directory `/etc/pve/priv/ceph` with

 mkdir /etc/pve/priv/ceph

Then copy the secret

 scp <cephserver>:/etc/ceph/cephfs.secret /etc/pve/priv/ceph/<STORAGE_ID>.secret

The secret must be named to match your `<STORAGE_ID>`. Copying the
secret generally requires root privileges. The file must only contain the
secret itself, opposed to the `rbd` backend.

If Ceph is installed locally on the PVE cluster, this is done automatically.

Storage Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `cephfs` backend is a POSIX-compliant filesystem on top of a Ceph cluster.
