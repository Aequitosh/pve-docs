User Mode iSCSI Backend
-----------------------

Storage pool type: `iscsidirect`

This backend provides basically the same functionality as the
Open-iSCSI backed, but uses a user-level library (package 'libiscsi2')
to implement it.

It should be noted that there are no kernel drivers involved, so this
can be viewed as performance optimization. But this comes with the
drawback that you cannot use LVM on top of such iSCSI LUN. So you need
to manage all space allocations at the storage server side.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The user mode iSCSI backend uses the same configuration options as the
Open-iSCSI backed.

.Configuration Example ('/etc/pve/storage.cfg')
