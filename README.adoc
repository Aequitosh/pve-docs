Proxmox VE Documentation
========================

What is this?
-------------

This is an experimental project, trying to generate high quality
documentation for http://www.proxmox.com[Proxmox VE]. We choose to use
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] as base format.

One idea is to generate high quality manual pages, and assemble them
into a complete book, called link:pve-admin-guide.adoc[Proxmox VE
Administration Guide].  So we have one source, and generate several
documents from that. It is also possible to generate printable PDF
files, or ebook formats ('.ebup').

Autogenerated CLI Command Synopsis
----------------------------------

We generate the command line synopsis for all manual pages
automatically. We can do that, because we have a full declarative
definition of the {pve} API. I added those generated files
('*-synopsis.adoc') to the git repository, so that it is possible to
build the documentation without having a fully installed {pve}
development environment.
