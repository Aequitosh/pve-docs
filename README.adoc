Proxmox VE Documentation
========================
include::attributes.txt[]

We try to generate high quality documentation for
http://www.proxmox.com[Proxmox VE], and choose to use
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] as base format.

The basic idea is to generate high quality manual pages, and assemble
them into a complete book, called link:pve-admin-guide.adoc[Proxmox VE
Administration Guide].  So we have one source, and generate several
documents from that. It is also possible to generate printable PDF
files, or ebook formats ('.ebup').

When possible, we provide scripts to extract API definitions,
configuration or command line options from the source code.

To simplify the documentation task, we keep all Documentation within
this repository. It is possible to generate the docs without installing
any additional Proxmox packages with:

 make index

To update the auto-generate API definitions use:

 make update

NOTE: you need a fully installed development environment for that.


Debian Packages
---------------

We generate a development package called 'pve-doc-generator', which is
used by other Proxmox VE package to generate manual pages at package
build time.

Another package called 'pve-docs' is used to publish generated
'.html' and '.pdf' files on our web servers. You can generate
those debian packages using:

 make deb


Common Macro definition in link:attributes.txt[]
------------------------------------------------

'asciidoc' allows us to define common macros, which can then be
referred to using `{macro}`. We try to use this mechanism to improve
consistency. For example, we defined a macro called `pve`, which
expands to "Proxmox VE". The plan is to add more such definitions for
terms which are used more than once.

Autogenerated CLI Command Synopsis
----------------------------------

We generate the command line synopsis for all manual pages
automatically. We can do that, because we have a full declarative
definition of the {pve} API. I added those generated files
('*-synopsis.adoc') to the git repository, so that it is possible to
build the documentation without having a fully installed {pve}
development environment.
