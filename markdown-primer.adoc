Markdown Primer
===============

[quote, John Gruber, https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/]
____
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you
to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert
it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
____

The {pve} web-interface has support for using Markdown to rendering rich text
formatting in node and virtual guest notes.

{pve} supports CommonMark with most extensions of GFM (GitHub Flavoured Markdown),
like tables or task-lists.

Markdown Basics
---------------

Note that we only describe the basics here, please search the web for more
extensive resources, for example on https://www.markdownguide.org/

Headings
~~~~~~~~

----
# This is a Heading h1
## This is a Heading h2 
##### This is a Heading h5
----


Emphasis
~~~~~~~~

Use `*text*` or `_text_` for emphasis.

Use `**text**` or `__text__` for bold, heavy-weight text.

Combinations are also possible, for example:

----
_You **can** combine them_
----

Links
~~~~~

You can use automatic detection of links, for example,
`https://forum.proxmox.com/` would transform it into a clickable link.

You can also control the link text, for example:

----
Now, [the part in brackets will be the link text](https://forum.proxmox.com/).
----

Lists
~~~~~

Unordered Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists, for example:

----
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 2a
* Item 2b
----

Adding an indentation can be used to created nested lists.

Ordered Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

----
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
  1. Item 3a
  1. Item 3b
----

NOTE: The integer of ordered lists does not need to be correct, they will be numbered automatically.

Task Lists
^^^^^^^^^^

Task list use a empty box `[ ]` for unfinished tasks and a box with an `X` for finished tasks.

For example:

----
- [X] First task already done!
- [X] Second one too
- [ ] This one is still to-do
- [ ] So is this one
----

Tables
~~~~~~

Tables use the pipe symbol `|` to separate columns, and `-` to separate the
table header from the table body, in that separation one can also set the text
alignment, making one column left-, center-, or right-aligned.

----
| Left columns  | Right columns |  Some  | More | Cols.| Centering Works Too
| ------------- |--------------:|--------|------|------|:------------------:|
| left foo      | right foo     | First  | Row  | Here | >center<           |
| left bar      | right bar     | Second | Row  | Here | 12345              |
| left baz      | right baz     | Third  | Row  | Here | Test               |
| left zab      | right zab     | Fourth | Row  | Here | ☁️☁️☁️              |
| left rab      | right rab     | And    | Last | Here | The End            |
----

Note that you do not need to align the columns nicely with white space, but that makes
editing tables easier.

Block Quotes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can enter block quotes by prefixing a line with `>`, similar as in plain-text emails.

>> and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

Code and Snippets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use backticks to avoid processing for a few word or paragraphs. That is useful for
avoiding that a code or configuration hunk gets mistakenly interpreted as markdown.

Inline code
^^^^^^^^^^^

Surrounding part of a line with single backticks allows to write code inline,
for examples:

----
This hosts IP address is `10.0.0.1`.
----

Whole blocks of code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For code blocks spanning several lines you can use triple-backticks to start
and end such a block, for example:

----
```
# This is the network config I want to remember here
auto vmbr2
iface vmbr2 inet static
        address 10.0.0.1/24
        bridge-ports ens20
        bridge-stp off
        bridge-fd 0
        bridge-vlan-aware yes
        bridge-vids 2-4094

```
