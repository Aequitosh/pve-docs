Cluster Manager
===============
include::attributes.txt[]
endif::manvolnum[]

The {PVE} cluster manager 'pvecm' is a tool to create a group of
physical servers. Such group is called a *cluster*. We use the
http://www.corosync.org[Corosync Cluster Engine] for reliable group
communication, and such cluster can consists of up to 32 physical nodes
(probably more, dependent on network latency).

'pvecm' can be used to create a new cluster, join nodes to a cluster,
leave the cluster, get status information and do various other cluster
related tasks. The Proxmox Cluster file system (pmxcfs) is used to
transparently distribute the cluster configuration to all cluster
nodes.

Grouping nodes into a cluster has the following advantages:

* Centralized, web based management

* Multi-master clusters: Each node can do all management task

* Proxmox Cluster file system (pmxcfs): Database-driven file system
  for storing configuration files, replicated in real-time on all
  nodes using corosync.

* Easy migration of Virtual Machines and Containers between physical
  hosts

* Fast deployment

* Cluster-wide services like firewall and HA


Requirements
------------

* All nodes must be in the same network as corosync uses IP Multicast
 to communicate between nodes (also see
 http://www.corosync.org[Corosync Cluster Engine]). Corosync uses UDP
 ports 5404 and 5405 for cluster communication.
+
NOTE: Some switches do not support IP multicast by default and must be
manually enabled first.

* Date and time have to be synchronized.

* SSH tunnel on TCP port 22 between nodes is used. 

* If you are interested in High Availability, you need to have at
  least three nodes for reliable quorum. All nodes should have the
  same version.

* We recommend a dedicated NIC for the cluster traffic, especially if
  you use shared storage.

NOTE: It is not possible to mix Proxmox VE 3.x and earlier with
Proxmox VE 4.0 cluster nodes.


Preparing Nodes
---------------

First, install {PVE} on all nodes. Make sure that each node is
installed with the final hostname and IP configuration. Changing the
hostname and IP is not possible after cluster creation.

Currently the cluster creation has to be done on the console, so you
need to login via 'ssh'.

Create the Cluster
------------------

Login via 'ssh' to the first Proxmox VE node. Use a unique name for
your cluster. This name cannot be changed later.

 hp1# pvecm create YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME

CAUTION: The cluster name is used to compute the default multicast
address. Please use unique cluster names if you run more than one
cluster inside your network.

To check the state of your cluster use:

 hp1# pvecm status


Adding Nodes to the Cluster
---------------------------

Login via 'ssh' to the node you want to add.

 hp2# pvecm add IP-ADDRESS-CLUSTER

For `IP-ADDRESS-CLUSTER` use the IP from an existing cluster node.

CAUTION: A new node cannot hold any VMÂ´s, because you would get
conflicts about identical VM IDs. Also, all existing configuration in
'/etc/pve' is overwritten when you join a new node to the cluster. To
workaround, use vzdump to backup and restore to a different VMID after
adding the node to the cluster.

To check the state of cluster:

 # pvecm status

Remove a Cluster Node
---------------------

CAUTION: Read carefully the procedure before proceeding, as it could
not be what you want or need.

Move all virtual machines from the node. Make sure you have no local
data or backups you want to keep, or save them accordingly.

Log in to one remaining node via ssh. Issue a 'pvecm nodes' command to
identify the node ID:

----
hp1# pvecm status

IMPORTANT: at this point you must power off the node to be removed and
make sure that it will not power on again (in the network) as it
is.

Log in to one remaining node via ssh. Issue the delete command (here
deleting node hp4):

 hp1# pvecm delnode hp4

If the operation succeeds no output is returned, just check the node
list again with 'pvecm nodes' or 'pvecm status'. You should see
something like:

IMPORTANT: as said above, it is very important to power off the node
*before* removal, and make sure that it will *never* power on again
(in the existing cluster network) as it is.

If you power on the node as it is, your cluster will be screwed up and
it could be difficult to restore a clean cluster state.

If, for whatever reason, you want that this server joins the same
cluster again, you have to

* reinstall pve on it from scratch

* then join it, as explained in the previous section.


Quorum
------

{pve} use a quorum-based technique to provide a consistent state among
all cluster nodes.

[quote, from Wikipedia, Quorum (distributed computing)]
____
A quorum is the minimum number of votes that a distributed transaction
has to obtain in order to be allowed to perform an operation in a
distributed system.
____

In case of network partitioning, state changes requires that a
majority of nodes are online. The cluster switches to read-only mode
if it loose quorum.

NOTE: {pve} assigns a single vote to each node by default.


Cluster Cold Start
------------------

It is obvious that a cluster is not quorate when all nodes are
offline. This is a common case after a power failure.

NOTE: It is always a good idea to use an uninterruptible power supply
('UPS', also called 'battery backup') to avoid this state. Especially if
you want HA.

On node startup, service 'pve-manager' waits up to 60 seconds to reach
quorum, and then starts all guests. If it fails to get quorum, that
service simply aborts, and you need to start your guest manually once
you have quorum.

If you start all nodes at the same time (for example when power comes
back), it is likely that you reach quorum within above timeout. But
startup can fail if some nodes starts much faster than others, so you
need to start your guest manually after reaching quorum. You can do
that on the GUI, or on the command line with:

 systemctl start pve-manager
