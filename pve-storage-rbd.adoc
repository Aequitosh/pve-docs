Storage pool type: `rbd`

http://ceph.com[Ceph] is a distributed object store and file system
designed to provide excellent performance, reliability and
scalability. RADOS block devices implement a feature rich block level
storage, and you get the following advantages:

* thin provisioning
* resizable volumes
* distributed and redundant (striped over multiple OSDs)
* full snapshot and clone capabilities
* self healing
* no single point of failure
* scalable to the exabyte level 
* kernel and user space implementation available

NOTE: For smaller deployments, it is also possible to run Ceph
services directly on your {pve} nodes. Recent hardware has plenty
of CPU power and RAM, so running storage services and VMs on same node
is possible.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This backend supports the common storage properties `nodes`,
`disable`, `content`, and the following `rbd` specific properties:

monhost::

List of monitor daemon IPs.

pool::

Ceph pool name.

username::

RBD user Id.

krbd::

Access rbd through krbd kernel module. This is required if you want to
use the storage for containers.

.Configuration Example (`/etc/pve/storage.cfg`)
----
rbd: ceph3
        monhost 10.1.1.20 10.1.1.21 10.1.1.22
        pool ceph3
        content images
        username admin
----

TIP: You can use the `rbd` utility to do low-level management tasks.

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you use `cephx` authentication, you need to copy the keyfile from
Ceph to Proxmox VE host.

Create the directory `/etc/pve/priv/ceph` with

 mkdir /etc/pve/priv/ceph

Then copy the keyring

 scp <cephserver>:/etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring /etc/pve/priv/ceph/<STORAGE_ID>.keyring

The keyring must be named to match your `<STORAGE_ID>`. Copying the
keyring generally requires root privileges.

Storage Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `rbd` backend is a block level storage, and implements full
snapshot and clone functionality.
