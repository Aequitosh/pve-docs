External Metric Server
----------------------

:pve-toplevel:

Starting with {pve} 4.0, you can define external metric servers, which will
be sent various stats about your hosts, virtual machines and storages.

Currently supported are:

 * Graphite (see http://graphiteapp.org )
 * InfluxDB (see https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/influxdb/ )

The server definitions are saved in '/etc/pve/status.cfg'

Graphite server configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The definition of a server is:

----
 graphite: your-id
    server your-server
    port your-port
    path your-path
----

where your-port defaults to *2003* and your-path defaults to *proxmox*

{pve} sends the data over UDP, so the graphite server has to be configured
for this.

Influxdb plugin configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The definition is:

----
 influxdb: your-id
    server your-server
    port your-port
----

{pve} sends the data over UDP, so the influxdb server has to be configured
for this.

Here is an example configuration for influxdb (on your influxdb server):

----
 [[udp]]
   enabled = true
   bind-address = "0.0.0.0:8089"
   database = "proxmox"
   batch-size = 1000
   batch-timeout = "1s"
----

With this configuration, your server listens on all IP addresses on
port 8089, and writes the data in the *proxmox* database

Multiple Definitions and Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *id* is optional, but if you want to have multiple definitions of a single
type, then the ids must be defined and different from each other.

Here is an example of a finished status.cfg

----
 graphite:
    server 10.0.0.5

 influxdb: influx1
    server 10.0.0.6
    port 8089

 influxdb: influx2
    server 10.0.0.7
    port 8090
----
