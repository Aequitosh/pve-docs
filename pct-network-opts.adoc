`bridge`: `<vmbr<Number>>` ::

Bridge to attach the network device to.

`firewall`: `<[1|0]>` ::

Controls whether this interface's firewall rules should be used.

`gw`: `<GatewayIPv4>` ::

Default gateway for IPv4 traffic.

`gw6`: `<GatewayIPv6>` ::

Default gateway for IPv6 traffic.

`hwaddr`: `<MAC>` ::

The interface MAC address. This is dynamically allocated by default, but
you can set that statically if needed, for example to always have the same
link-local IPv6 address. (lxc.network.hwaddr)

`ip`: `<IPv4Format/CIDR>` ::

IPv4 address in CIDR format.

`ip6`: `<IPv6Format/CIDR>` ::

IPv6 address in CIDR format.

`mtu`: `<Number>` ::

Maximum transfer unit of the interface. (lxc.network.mtu)

`name`: `<String>` ::

Name of the network device as seen from inside the container.
(lxc.network.name)

`rate`: `<mbps>` ::

Apply rate limiting to the interface

`tag`: `<VlanNo>` ::

VLAN tag for this interface.

`trunks`: `<vlanid[;vlanid...]>` ::

VLAN ids to pass through the interface

`type`: `(veth)` ::

Network interface type.
